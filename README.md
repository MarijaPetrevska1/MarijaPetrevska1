# Hi there! 👋👩‍💻
I am Marija Petrevska. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm focused on **Web Development**, exploring technologies like C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, Web API, SQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. 💻

Currently, I am learning Angular and TypeScript, building small projects and experimenting to improve my skills.

I enjoy creating meaningful and creative projects while sharing my learning journey — feel free to check out my repositories! ⭐🌸📚
